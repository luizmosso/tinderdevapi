# Simple Social Media API

This is a simple web api. Built to provide the data needed for applications that work with instagram-style user posts. Implemented entirely in javascript under nodejs platform using the express framework. We chose the non-relational database mongodb and applied websocket communication for real time data update in client applications.

## Getting Started

To run the api, just run the command to install node dependencies such as "npm install" or "yarn install". Then run the "yarn dev" command that references a script configured in the package.json file.

### Prerequisites

An environment variable file that stores the mongodb connection string through mongoose was used. It contains variable called CONNECTIONSTRING as shown below:

CONNECTIONSTRING=...
